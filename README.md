A barebones (Linux) terminal-based text chat program using the UDP protocol.
The purpose was trial-and-erroring into learning the Linux socket API, while intentionally limiting myself to UDP despite TCP being more suited to the task. As expected, the code is rather messy, but it works, and I learned a bunch.
The program must be started with either the 'server' or 'client' argument to start or join a chat room, respectively. It will then prompt the user for more information.
