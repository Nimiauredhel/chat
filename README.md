A barebones (Linux) terminal-based text chat program using the UDP protocol.
The purpose was trial-and-erroring the Linux socket API into submission, so the code is rather messy.
But it works, and I learned a bunch.
Must be started with either the 'server' or 'client' argument to start or join a chat room, respectively.
